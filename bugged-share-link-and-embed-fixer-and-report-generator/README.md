# Universal Embed Fixer

A simple but powerful web tool to generate clean, correct, and stable embed codes from YouTube and Spotify URLs. It helps bypass platform bugs and ensures you get the right content embedded on your website or blog every time.

## The Problem

Have you ever tried to share a song from Spotify or a video from YouTube, only to find that the embedded player shows the wrong content, doesn't work, or looks broken?

This often happens because the "share" links provided by these platforms contain extra tracking parameters (like `?si=...`), use short-link formats (`youtu.be`), or are not standard embed URLs. This tool fixes that.

## How It Works

The Universal Embed Fixer intelligently analyzes the URL you provide, extracts the unique content ID, and rebuilds a perfect, robust `<iframe>` embed code from scratch.

## How to Use the App

1.  **Paste Your URL**: Copy a URL from YouTube, YouTube Music, or Spotify (for tracks, albums, playlists, or podcasts) and paste it into the input field.
2.  **Generate Code**: Click the "Generate" button.
3.  **Review the Fix**: The app will show you a live preview of the embed and explain what it fixed in the "What We Fixed" section.
4.  **Copy the Code**: Click the "Copy" button to copy the clean HTML embed code to your clipboard.
5.  **Paste on Your Site**: Go to your website editor, blog post, or any platform that supports custom HTML, and paste the code where you want the player to appear.
